Pushed First Commit to Github With 'git push -f origin main' WHY
*"The tip of your current branch is behind its remote counterpart"* means that there have been changes on the remote branch that you donâ€™t have locally. 
And Git tells you to import new changes from REMOTE and merge it with your code and then push it to remote.

You can use this command to force changes to the server with the local repository (). remote repo code will be replaced with your local repo code.
'git push -f origin main'
With the -f tag you will override the remote branch code with your local repo code.

ANOTHER REPLY FROM GITHUB COMMUNITY

Hey there! This is what I found on the internet for the error you are encountering:

First a basic recap:

The error message you're encountering, "Updates Rejected because the Tip of Your Current Branch is behind Its Remote Counterpart," typically means that your local branch is not up-to-date with the remote branch on GitHub.

Local vs. Remote: In Git, you have a local repository (on your computer) and a remote repository (on GitHub, in this case). These are separate copies of the same project.

Branches: Git allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously. Each person usually works on their own branch. A branch is essentially a series of commits (changes) in the project's history.

Pushing: When you make changes to your local branch and want to share them with others, you "push" those changes to the remote branch on GitHub.

Error: The error you're seeing occurs because someone else has made changes to the remote branch since you last synchronized your local branch with it. Git is designed to prevent you from accidentally overwriting someone else's work.

How to fix the problem:

Pull the Latest Changes: Before pushing your changes, it's essential to ensure your local branch is up-to-date with the remote branch. You can do this by running git pull origin branch-name. Replace branch-name with the name of your branch.

Resolve Conflicts (If Any): If there are any conflicting changes (changes made to the same lines of code by you and others), Git will ask you to resolve them. You'll need to manually choose which changes to keep.

Push Your Changes: After you've pulled the latest changes and resolved any conflicts, you can push your changes to GitHub using git push origin branch-name.

Pull Request: If you're working collaboratively with others, you'll usually create a "pull request" on GitHub to propose your changes. This allows others to review your code before it's merged into the main branch.
